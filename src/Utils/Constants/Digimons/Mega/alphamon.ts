  description: `Alphamon is a Warrior Digimon and a carrier of the X-Antibody. While it is one of the "Royal Knights", it is said that, to the Holy Knights, it is a being similar to a deterrent force, and as it doesn\`t appear in normal times, it is also called the "Aloof Hermit" who flutters a blue mantle, and is the Royal Knight assigned to the place called the "Empty Seat". Because it possesses the "Alpha inForce" ability, an ultimate force which, in battle, instantaneously replays the elapsed battle, although Alphamon\`s attacks are over in just an instant, you can\`t grasp how many attacks it actually unleashed, and in theory, you can only see the final blow that brought down its opponent. It can deploy a magic circle of DigiCode from its hands to perform offense and defense. It wields the "Divine Sword Grade Alpha" (聖剣グレイダルファー Seiken Gureidarufā?, lit. "Holy Sword Gradalpha"), which is based on Grademon\`s "Souken Gradalpha" (双剣グレイダルファー Souken Gureidarufā?, Twin Swords Gradalpha).`,
