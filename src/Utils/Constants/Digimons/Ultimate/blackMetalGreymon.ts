  description: `Black MetalG reymon is a Cyborg Digimon. It is the strongest Cyborg Digimon, and after going through numerous battles, it was able to survive by mechanizing more than half its body, using technology appropriated from Andromon. The MetalGreymon of File Island were able to drastically extend their vital functions through remodeling, but their flesh portions could not hold out and were discolored blue. In order to digivolve to MetalGreymon, it must fight its way through and defeat the formidable opponents who come against it. Also, its offensive power is said to equal that of a single nuclear warhead.`,
